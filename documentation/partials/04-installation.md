# Installation
This guide will show you how to **setup GitHub CMS across three separate repositories** aligning to the following roles:
- Source Content Repository
- Target Publication Repository
- Meta Repository

Although separate repositories makes the components of the system very clear, it is not a requirement that you create one repository per role.  

**GitHub CMS can be setup in a single repository, if you wish**.  Simply use the same repository as you follow the setup instructions below.
